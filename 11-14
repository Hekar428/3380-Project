11. Primary market:
	Our primary market consists of the avid readers.  We want to make our product widely accessible to the average person 
	who loves to read.  These are the people that we target for our “playlist for books” feature that will allow people to 
	make lists of books, owned or not owned, and share them with family and friends.  

12. Market size:
	The market of creating databases of books have been around for hundreds of years.  Up until recently though,
	these databases are now stored on computers and over the web.  Although the market for organization has been around 
	for a while, the electronic part has not been.  This is a growing market and gains more and more users, both companies 
	and individuals, who revert from the older, less efficient ways of keeping a database and switch to computers.  

13. Secondary market:
	Small bookstores and book clubs will be our target secondary market.  We feel our product caters to the smaller groups
	of people so having the organizations with not too many people will benefit from our product the most.  
	People in book clubs can use this service and be able to compare and talk about how they think about certain books by
	just looking at what they wrote under their personal review.

14. Competition:
	Collectorez.com: This software is very intuitive and is able to sync across many different devices. 
	You are able to sort and search your book collections and export your data to the mobile apps or share online. 
	They lack the book playlist feature we will bring to the table. 
	
	Conventional databases: We will still have to compete with the older, more out of date databases out there because
	some people would rather stick with what they know, then to be more efficient.  The advantage of non-computer databases
	are that they don’t require electricity to function, you can keep everything on pen and paper and be backed up forever.
