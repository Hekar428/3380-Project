2. The Vision
Online apps and gadgets have become more and more popular over recent years. We hope to make our application used by many who are in the literary world. This way they can keep track of which books someone has as well as show off your library to friends. Basically it will be your own personal database containing your library of books for you.

3. Gap in the market
There are currently no types of applications to help organize somebody’s collection of books. Right now we could begin to market ourselves to local bookstores and the customers of those stores initially. Next we could begin to advertise ourselves to different book clubs around the area. 
There is no type of application like ours offered at the moment. Our application is unique. Readers will instantly see the worth of our product whenever they see how easily it is to store and categorize which books they possess.
 Since we do not plan to store the actual books we save a huge amount of space cost. This makes our application have a small storage overhead for customer use making it economic. We will not have to worry much about taking up too much room on someone’s computer.
All together our product will be successful because it has a niche in the market and can fulfill a purpose while not being bulky or inconvenient to handle.

4.  Meeting the market’s needs
There is no type of software that fulfills the purpose of our application. It is convenient to have your entire book library at your finger tips for you to check out or to show to your friends. It is a desirable product for readers so it is filling up an empty spot in the market. This will allow us to make a profit without having any type of competition at least initially.
