9. Industry need for our technology: 
The ability to be organized is always a need for whoever has things that can get cluttered.  
What we hope to do is to give aid for personal and company use so that they can spend less time looking for books, 
and more time enjoying them.  We hope to make businesses like bookstores be more efficient by having an easy to use database where all of their books can be stored.  

10.  Market analysis:
In the market, we have very little competition but the biggest one will be the database service offered from collectorz.com. 
This software is very mature and has many features at its disposal.  Our goal is to convince users that our software 
is more geared to be simplistic with just the essential features needed to be the most organized as possible.
